# RegMask:
A small tool that makes generating bit masks easy.

It shows  visual view of a 32-bit register, where you can toggle each bit simply by clicking on it.
The value of the register is updated and it can be copied to the clipboard by a click on Copy button.
The register can be reset to 0 by clear button.
The window is always on top so you can switch focus to your editor without losing the window.

# Todo:
Add an option to keep on top or not.
